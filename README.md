## What is Trust Name Space ?

Trust Name Space (TNS) is a standart that helps manage reputation and verify the accuracy of information on the Internet. It runs on Ethereum blockchain technology, which makes it reliable. In an age where artificial intelligence can easily create fake news, TNS aims to train people to check sources of information. This is achieved thanks to the reliability of blockchain technologies and the use of cryptographic signatures for documents. TNS uses a unique economic model. They distribute 85% of the value of names to the owners of those names. Their system also uses the deflationary token model of the $True project, where 10% of the tokens from the initial value of the name are destroyed.

## Mission TNS

One of the main problems of interaction in the Internet space is the loss of authenticity of information online. Today we live in the era of zero trust. 

The era of the Wild West and "zero trust" in Web3 forms a high cost and high risk of losing the user's crypto assets, which limits the scope of blockchain technologies. 
The obvious solutions today in the form of linking biometrics to identity reproduce the concept of a digital concentration camp, we fundamentally disagree with these mechanics and want to create a healthy alternative that does not require you to have biometrics, while providing you with the basic principles of indexing and trust in the network of the future. 
This may be the only way to transition to a decentralized internet of the future that preserves the basic rights and freedoms of its participants. 
This future is possible now, it has arrived, with the joining of your name to the namespace you become its participant together with hundreds of thousands of users at the start. 
Our mission is to create a unique universal identifier on the Internet for each subject of interaction, forming trust in the party of interaction. 
An indicator inside the trust space.
